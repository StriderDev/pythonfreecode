Are you a vineyard? Because I'd wander 40 years in the desert just to find a date with you, Old Testament style.
Are you a burning bush? Because you've got me feeling all fired up like Moses on Mount Sinai.
Are you a copy of Genesis? Because you've got me saying, "Let there be a second date!"
Are you a theme at BYU? Because you've got me seeking instructions from the Spirit on how to approach you.
